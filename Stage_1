We have selected the veterinary clinic management system for our class project. Our system will include the following features:

1) Patient Registry - to include pictures of owner and dog. 
2) Treatment History - spot for Dr notes and prescribed medications (maybe have refill reminders?)
3) Appointments Scheduled, calendars showing time off for employees, surgery bookings, check ups, etc.
4) Billing History - might be able to roll this into treatment history since they are inherently linked. 
5) Ability to upload documents
6) Ability to print
7) Maybe some way to track the animals currently being held at the office? ex: Dog A gets checked in and goes to kennel 5. Then gets moved to surgery
    and then gets moved to kennel 7 for recovery.
8) Automated client satisfaction surveys sent out x days after visit?
9) Automated client reminders sent out at one or multiple intervals before appointment. Maybe something that sends a message to a client wishing their dog a happy birthday?
10) Internal transaction history like buying office/medical supplies. Maybe compare the cost to buy supplies with what is charged for procedures using those supplies to
    make sure the practice isn't losing money should supply costs increase? Include vendor contact information for ordered items.
11) Generate reports like Production Reports, Costs Reports, Account Receivables Report, Inventory Reports, Client Reports, etc. Maybe ties them in to reminders to order 
    more of x or check up on a client that hasn't been to the vets office in a while.
12) Payment plan
