We have selected the veterinary clinic management system for our class project. Our system will include the following features:

1) Patient Registry - to include pictures of owner and dog. 
2) Treatment History - spot for Dr notes and prescribed medications (maybe have refill reminders?)
3) Appointments Scheduled
4) Billing History - might be able to roll this into treatment history since they are inherently linked. 
5) Ability to upload documents
6) Ability to print
7) Maybe some way to track the animals currently being held at the office? ex: Dog A gets checked in and goes to kennel 5. Then gets moved to surgery
    and then gets moved to kennel 7 for recovery.
